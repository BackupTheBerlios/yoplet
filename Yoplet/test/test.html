<h1>Welcome to the Yoplet, the file manipulation applet</h1>

<p>Yoplet helps you

<ul>
  <li>Write down to a local file</li>
  <li>Read up a local file</li>
  <li>Watch for a local file alteration (creation, modification, deletion)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applet creation via HTML, action call via Javacript</h2>

<p>Here, the applet element is hard coded in HTML coded but will perform one action (sleep mode), 
then javascript on <tt>action</tt> parameter value.</p>

<h2>Applet creation via Javascript</h2>

<p>Here, the applet element is dynamically created with a Javascript helper object named <tt>Yoplet</tt>.
Clicking on a button will ask <tt>Yoplet</tt> to create a <tt>&lt;applet&gt;</tt> element, 
with appropriate parameters, then trigger the action by attaching the element to the DOM.
depending on <tt>action</tt> parameter value. If you click to another action button,
<tt>Yoplet</tt> will remove the former <tt>&lt;applet&gt;</tt> and will create a new one</p>

<script type="text/javascript">

var YopletCreator = {
  options : {
    parentElement: "js-applet"
  },

    code: "org.yoplet.Yoplet.class",
